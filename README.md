====================

Here you can find the 3 exercices asked for the onepoint Python test.

The exercices are split across 3 Python files named `integersums.py`, `ceasar.py` and
`majority_element.py`.

`Onepoint` content
==================

- *integersums.py*: Takes a single integer as input and returns the sum of the integers from zero to the input parameter
- *ceasar.py*: Simple substitution cipher in which each letter of the plain text is substituted with a 
    letter found by moving n places down the alphabet.
- *majority_element.py*: The element that appears more than floor(n / 2) times,
    where n is the length of the list.
